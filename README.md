# peer-2-peer
This repository presents the randomisation process. It has two notebooks
- 01
- 02

For a better understanding on how everything is working. Go through notebook 1. Notebook 2 is a little bit simplified and easy to use
If you are just doing randomisation, you can jump straight to notebook 2.

The rest of the repos contain the functions that are being used by the second notebook.
